## What is roomTap?

roomTap is a simple web application allowing roommates to reserve a room within their house and notify all roommates of why, when and where in order to avoid scheduling conflicts.

Have you ever thought, wow, I would love to make dinner for my female friend? ...the day finally arrives and the kitchen is filthy and/or your roommates are busy playing drinking games! Boom... roomTap!
